# Sublog - Subscription Tracking App üìÖüí∏

**Sublog** is a user-friendly subscription tracking app that helps you stay on top of your subscriptions by sending timely reminders. With **Sublog**, you can easily manage all your subscriptions and receive email notifications a day before they renew. Never miss a payment again! üõéÔ∏è

This app is built using **React** (with **TypeScript**), **Framer Motion**, **Zustand**, and **Tailwind CSS** on the front-end. The back-end is powered by **Express.js** and MongoDB, with authentication and email notifications handled through JWT and Qstash.

## How It Works üîÑ

### Mongoose Subscription Schema

The app uses a **Subscription model** defined in Mongoose, which contains the following fields:

- **name**: Subscription name (2-100 characters)
- **price**: Subscription price (greater than 0)
- **currency**: Currency of the subscription (defaults to 'USD')
- **frequency**: Frequency of renewal ('daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'yearly')
- **category**: Subscription category (e.g., sports, news, entertainment)
- **paymentMethod**: Payment method used
- **status**: Subscription status ('active', 'cancelled', 'expired', default is 'active')
- **startDate**: Subscription start date (must be a valid past or current date)
- **renewalDate**: Subscription renewal date (optional, auto-calculated)
- **user**: Reference to the user who owns the subscription

### Subscription Expiry and Reminders

Before saving a subscription, the following happens automatically:

- **Pre-save hook**:
  - If no **renewalDate** is provided, it's automatically calculated based on the frequency.
  - If the **renewalDate** has passed, the subscription status is updated to 'expired'.
  
- **Email Reminder**: A day before the renewal date, users receive an email reminder that their subscription is about to renew.
